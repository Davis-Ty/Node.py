# Tree
-This Python script defines a binary tree structure and various traversal methods (inOrder, preOrder, postOrder). It also generates an adjacency list representation of the tree and performs breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS) traversal on the tree.

# Binary Tree Implementation: 
- The Node class represents a node in the binary tree. The insert method inserts new nodes into the tree.

# Traversal Methods:
- inOrderPrint, preOrderPrint, and postOrderPrint methods perform in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals of the tree, respectively.
- Adjacency List Generation: The makeList function creates an adjacency list representation of the tree.

# Search Algorithms:
- bfs and dfs functions perform breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS) traversals on the tree, respectively.
- search function checks if a given key exists in the tree.

# Usage:
- Instantiate a tree by creating a root node and inserting elements.
- Call the traversal methods or search functions as needed.
- This script demonstrates fundamental tree operations and search algorithms in Python, offering insight into tree data structures and traversal techniques.
